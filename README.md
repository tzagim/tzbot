#### `chat_list.json`

Template chat_list may be found in `chat_list.sample.json`. Rename it to `chat_list.json`.

This file contains the list of chats to forward messages from and to. The bot expect it to be an Array of objects with the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "source": -10012345678,
    "destination": [-10011111111, "-10022222222#123456"]
  },
  {
    "source": "-10087654321#000000", // Topic/Forum group
    "destination": ["-10033333333#654321"],
    "filters": ["word1", "word2"] // message that contain this word will be forwarded
  },
  {
    "source": -10087654321,
    "destination": [-10033333333],
    "blacklist": ["word3", "word4"] // message that contain this word will not be forwarded
  },
  {
    "source": -10087654321,
    "destination": [-10033333333],
    "filters": ["word5"],
    "blacklist": ["word6"]
    // message must contain word5 and must not contain word6 to be forwarded
  }
]
```

An example `config.env` file could be:

```env
BOT_TOKEN = 1234567890:Abcdef1234567890GHIJ
OWNER_ID = 1234567890, 0987654321
REMOVE_TAG = True
GROUPS_TO_DELETE = -1001234567890, -1234567890
TIME_TO_DELETE = 900
DEFAULT_LANG = en
APSCHEDULER_LOG_LEVEL = INFO
APSCHEDULER_SCHEDULER_INFO = 0
```
- `source` - The chat ID of the chat to forward messages from. It can be a group or a channel.

  > If the source chat is a Topic groups, you **MUST** explicitly specify the topic ID. The bot will ignore incoming message from topic group if the topic ID is not specified.

- `destination` - An array of chat IDs to forward messages to. It can be a group or a channel.

  > Destenation supports Topics chat. You can use `#topicID` string to forward to specific topic. Example: `[-10011111111, "-10022222222#123456"]`. With this config it will forward to chat `-10022222222` with topic `123456` and to chat `-10011111111` .

- `filters` (Optional) - An array of strings to filter words. If the message containes any of the strings in the array, it **WILL BE** forwarded.

- `blacklist` (Optional) - An array of strings to blacklist words. If the message containes any of the string in the array, it will **NOT BE** forwarded.

You may add as many objects as you want. The bot will forward messages from all the chats in the `source` field to all the chats in the `destination` field. Duplicates are allowed as it already handled by the bot.

It is also possible to enter several different filters on the same source.
